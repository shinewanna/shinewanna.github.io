What Launcher is Second Space???
You could ask second space is not like that.Yes, you're right the main purpose is that you can create Second Space in
Settings and Hide your private apps for First Space or Second Space.The difference of hiding in First Space and Second
Space is, if you want to hide your apps and also want to hide your Settings that you can use Second Space, no one can
customize your Settings except you.If you want to hide only apps you can use First Space only.Second Space doesn't have
Settings, you can't customize Second Space: Launcher's Settings in Second Space.You can only customize your Settings
only in First Space.If the user want to switch Second Space from First Space, the user must pass the user authentication
to switch.Thus, you can easily make private your apps from unknown users.So, it's sound like second space.I'm trying to
build similar feature of second space.Most people use Second Space feature for hide their apps from unknown users of
their phone.So I start with these feature.
<b>Features</b>
---------------------------
<b>Second Space</b> - Set password to make Second Space, and Hide your apps in Second Space to 0% access from unknown
users.Second Space doesn't have Settings.You should change to Second Space and then give your mobile to unknown
users.They can't find your hidden apps and Settings also.If you would like to change something in Settings, you could go
to First Space and then you can find Settings in First Space.
<b>Wallpaper</b> - You can set any wallpaper of your own.
<b>Personalization</b> - You can add-remove Apps in Home Screen.
<b>Search</b> - Search and go fast to your apps.
<b>Hide App</b> - Keep your apps private, create Second Space and make your apps full private.
<b>Settings</b> - Setting, it's for First Space.You can change Name and Icon of the Settings app of the Second Space:
Launcher.So other people wouldn't know where is your hiding place easily.Click Second Space to show Second Space's
Settings.
<b>Space Switch Button</b> - When you created Second Space, Space Switch Button will appear in bottom right of the Home
Screen.You can change the button position to do long press and drag wherever you want to move.You can also blur the
switch button in setting.
<b>No Ads</b> - Ads in Launcher is very annoying.

<b>Second Space: Launcher</b> — Dual Space Privacy Launcher for Android

Protect your privacy with <b>Second Space: Launcher</b> — a fast, lightweight, and clean Android launcher with a
built-in dual space system. Hide private apps, lock your second space, and fully customize your home screen experience.

<b>🔒 What is Second Space?</b>

Second Space lets you create two completely independent spaces on one phone. Your <b>First Space</b> is your main
launcher — fully customizable with all settings accessible. Your <b>Second Space</b> is a private, locked environment
where hidden apps and settings are completely invisible to anyone else.

Unlike simple app hiders, Second Space hides your <b>Settings page too</b> — so no one even knows a second space exists.

<b>✨ Key Features</b>

<b>🔐 Second Space (Dual Space)</b> Create a password-protected private space. Hidden apps and Settings are completely
inaccessible from Second Space. Hand your phone to anyone — they'll never find your private apps or settings.

<b>👁️ Hide Apps</b> Choose which apps to hide in First Space or Second Space. Apps disappear completely from home
screen and app drawer — not just in a folder.

<b>🔑 Space Lock & Authentication</b> Switch between spaces only after passing authentication — PIN, Pattern, Password,
Fingerprint or Face ID. Full biometric support.

<b>👆 Gesture Controls</b> Switch spaces using custom gestures — swipe, double tap, pinch and more. Fully configurable
gesture types for fast, natural space switching.

<b>🎨 Home Screen Personalization</b> Add or remove apps from your home screen. Choose grid size, icon size, icon shape,
icon labels and more. Make each space look completely different.

<b>🖼️ Wallpaper</b> Set any wallpaper for your home screen. Personalize each space with its own unique wallpaper.

<b>🔄 Space Switch Button</b> A floating switch button appears on your home screen when Second Space is created. Long
press and drag to reposition. Blur or hide it in settings for extra privacy.

<b>🔍 App Search</b> Quickly find and launch any app with the built-in search bar in the app drawer.

<b>📋 App Drawer</b> Clean dual app drawer showing both spaces. Sort by name, category, most used or recently added.

<b>⚙️ Settings (First Space Only)</b> All launcher settings are accessible only from First Space — giving you full
control while keeping Second Space completely clean and private. You can even rename and change the Settings icon so
others won't recognize it.

<b>🚫 No Ads</b> Ads in a launcher are annoying. Second Space: Launcher is completely ad-free.

<b>🔎 Who is Second Space: Launcher for?</b>

✅ People who share their phone with family or friends
✅ Anyone who wants to separate work and personal apps
✅ Users who want to hide private apps beyond a simple folder
✅ Anyone who wants full privacy without a second device

<b>📱 Device Requirements</b>

Supports Android 7.0 (API 24) and above. Optimized for Android 14 & 15.

📄 Full Description (SEO Optimized & Expanded)
<b>Second Space: Launcher</b> — #1 Dual Space Privacy Launcher for Android

Are you looking for a launcher that truly protects your privacy? <b>Second Space: Launcher</b> is a fast, clean, and
lightweight Android home screen launcher with a powerful built-in dual space system. Whether you want to hide private
apps, separate work from personal life, or keep your phone secure when sharing — Second Space has you covered.

<b>🔒 What Makes Second Space Different?</b>

Most launchers offer simple app hiding — just tucking apps into a folder. <b>Second Space goes further.</b> It creates
two completely independent environments on one device:

➡️ <b>First Space</b> — Your main home screen. Full access to all apps, settings, and customization. ➡️ <b>Second
  Space</b> — A locked, private environment. Hidden apps AND settings are completely invisible. No one knows they exist.

This is not just an app hider. This is a <b>full dual space experience</b> — like having two phones in one.

<b>✨ Features</b>

<b>🔐 Dual Space System</b> Create a completely separate second space on your Android phone. Second Space has no
Settings page — making it impossible for others to discover or change anything. Hand your phone to anyone in Second
Space mode — they'll only see what you want them to see.

<b>👁️ Hide Apps — Deeply Private</b> Select any app to hide in First Space or Second Space. Hidden apps vanish
completely from the home screen, app drawer, and search — not just moved to a folder. No trace left behind.

<b>🔑 Independent Lock for Each Space</b> Each space has its own independent lock. Choose from PIN, Pattern, Password,
Fingerprint, or Face ID. Switching from First Space to Second Space — or back — requires authentication every time. Your
private space stays private, always.

<b>👆 Custom Gesture Controls</b> Switch between spaces naturally using custom gestures. Choose from Swipe Up, Swipe
Left/Right, Double Tap, Pinch, Long Press, or Floating Button. Configure the gesture that feels most natural to you for
instant space switching.

<b>🎨 Full Home Screen Personalization</b> Make your launcher truly yours. Customize grid size (3x3 to 6x6), icon size,
icon shape, icon labels, icon packs, folder styles, and more. Set a completely different look and feel for each space.

<b>🖼️ Wallpaper Support</b> Set any wallpaper from your gallery. Give each space its own unique wallpaper — personal
photo for First Space, minimal clean look for Second Space.

<b>📋 Dual App Drawer</b> View apps from both spaces in one clean app drawer. Switch between list and grid view. Sort by
name, category, most used, or recently added. Pin your most-used apps to the top for faster access.

<b>🔄 Space Switch Floating Button</b> A discreet floating button appears on your home screen for fast space switching.
Long press and drag to reposition anywhere on screen. Blur or hide the button from Settings for extra stealth and
privacy.

<b>🔍 Fast App Search</b> Find any app instantly with the built-in search bar. No more scrolling through pages — just
type and launch.

<b>⚙️ Settings — First Space Only</b> All launcher customization settings are locked inside First Space. Second Space
has zero settings access. You can even rename the Settings app icon and change its appearance — so others won't
recognize it even if they look.

<b>📐 Apps Layout Settings</b> Control exactly how apps are displayed. Choose grid or list layout, adjust icon spacing,
toggle app name labels, select transition animations between pages, and configure your dock icon count and style.

<b>🔲 App Categories & Grouping</b> Organize your app drawer by category, alphabetical order, or custom grouping. Keep
work apps, social apps, and personal apps neatly separated in each space.

<b>💾 Backup & Restore</b> Save your launcher layout, settings, and space configuration. Restore everything with one tap
— perfect when switching devices.

<b>🚫 Completely Ad-Free</b> Ads inside a launcher are distracting and annoying. Second Space: Launcher is 100% ad-free
— no banners, no pop-ups, no interruptions. Ever.

<b>⚡ Fast & Lightweight</b> Built with Flutter for smooth, native-feeling performance. Low memory usage, fast app
loading, and snappy animations — even on older Android devices.

<b>🙋 Who is Second Space: Launcher Perfect For?</b>

✅ People who share their phone with family, kids, or friends
✅ Professionals who want to separate work apps from personal apps
✅ Anyone who wants deeper privacy than a simple app hider
✅ Users who want a clean, customizable home screen launcher
✅ People who need dual space without buying a second phone
✅ Anyone who values privacy without complexity

Crash reporting services
Any third party SDKs that collect data
Children's Privacy
Our app is safe for all ages. Since we collect no data at all, there is no risk of collecting data from children under the age of 13.

Security
All your settings, space configurations, and preferences are stored locally on your device. We have no access to your data because we never receive it in the first place.

Your Second Space lock (PIN, Pattern, Password, Fingerprint, or Face ID) is handled entirely on-device and is never transmitted anywhere.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.

      <h2>No Third Party Services</h2>
      <p>Second Space: Launcher does not use any third party services that collect data. Specifically, we do not use:
      </p>

      <ul class="third-party-list" style="margin-top: 16px;">
        <li>Advertising SDKs — the app is 100% ad-free</li>
        <li>Cloud storage or sync services</li>
      </ul>

        <strong style="color: var(--text); display: block; margin-bottom: 8px;">Firebase (Google)</strong>
        We use Firebase services provided by Google LLC for the following purposes:
        <br><br>
        <strong style="color: var(--accent2)">Firebase Analytics</strong> — collects anonymous usage data such as screen
        views and app events to help us understand how the app is used and improve the user experience. This data is
        aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.
        <br><br>
        <strong style="color: var(--accent2)">Firebase Crashlytics</strong> — automatically collects crash reports when
        the app encounters an error. This helps us identify and fix bugs quickly. Crash reports may include device
        model, OS version, and app version at the time of the crash.

      <h2>All Data Stays On Your Device</h2>
      <p>The app stores your preferences locally using Hive — an on-device database. This includes your space
        configuration, hidden apps list, lock type, gesture settings, home screen layout, and wallpaper preferences.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        This local data is entirely under your control. Uninstalling the app removes all stored data from your device.
        We have no copy of it and no way to access it.

      <h2>Your Space Lock is Private</h2>
      <p>Your Second Space lock — whether PIN, Pattern, Password, Fingerprint, or Face ID — is stored and verified
        entirely on your device. It is never transmitted to any server or shared with anyone. Only you have access to
        your spaces.</p>
